Experiment 2 materials
======================

These are the HTML files that were used in Experiment 2. The names of the files indicate which comparison they make. For example, `C1F2vsC2F2_a.html` compares a choice with 1 chosen attribute (`C1`) and 2 forgone attributes (`F2`) to a choice with 2 chosen attributes (`C2`) and 2 forgone attributes (`F2`). There are two versions of each condition (`_a` and `_b`). The only difference between versions is which side each choice appears on.

There are also conditions that vary the number of choices (e.g. `Ch1vsCh3`) and number of options (e.g. `O2vsO4`).
