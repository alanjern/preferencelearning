Experiment 2 model code
=======================

This script was written in Matlab and uses the Parallel Computing Toolbox.

* `comparechoices.m`: This script is virtually identical to the script that generates model predictions for Experiment 1. The main difference is that this script makes the specific comparisons required for Experiment 2 after generating the importance samples.

The `*.mat` file contains the output of the above scripts and was used to generate the plots in the paper.
